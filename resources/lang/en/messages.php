        Youâ€™ve probably seen it - the rainbow coloured bridge next to Delft Station. A visible symbol that Delft is a rainbow city, and has been for nearly 10 years. However, this bridge is only temporary. We want to create a more permanent LGBT+ monument, one unique to Delft, and we want your help to think of what exactly!
        <br /><br />
        Between now and December 1st you can submit your idea for a statue or other standalone piece of art that represents the LGBT+ community. It can be a description in words or a sketch, whatever gets your idea across. We will work with a professional artist to turn the winning idea into reality.
        <br /><br />
        After the competition closes a panel of representatives from the various LGBT+ organisations in Delft will decide on the winning idea. This will be announced on Purple Friday, December 11th. Then a fundraising campaign will start to fund the winning idea. The winner will be invited to participate in the further development of the artwork and be part of its eventual reveal. They will also receive a smaller version of the artwork to take home.
