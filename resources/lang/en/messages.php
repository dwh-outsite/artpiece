        Youâ€™ve probably seen it - the rainbow coloured bridge next to Delft Station. A first visible symbol that Delft is a rainbow city, and has been for nearly 10 years. However, this bridge is only temporary. We want to create a more permanent LGBT+ monument which is more unique to Delft, and we want your help to think of what exactly!
        <br /><br />
        Between now and December 4th you can submit your idea for a statue or other standalone piece of art that represents the LGBT+ community. It can be just a description in words or a sketch, the winning idea will be given as part of the instructions to an artist.
        After the competition closes, a panel of representatives of the various LGBT+ organisations in Delft will decide on the winning idea, which will be announced on Purple Friday, December 11th, after which a fundraising campaign will start to fund it. If your idea wins, you can be part of the eventual reveal of the artwork and you will receive a small version of the artwork to take home.
